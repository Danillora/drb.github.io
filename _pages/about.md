I’m a PhD student in Political Science at the Graduate Program in Political Science (PPGCP) at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE). I hold a Master’s in Political Science (Democracy and Institutions) from the same program, as well as a B.A. in International Relations. I also have training in Public Policy Evaluation from the School of Innovation and Public Policies (EIPP/FUNDAJ).

My research interests include Public Policy Evaluation, Public Opinion, Evangelicals, and Data Analysis. I am a member of the Epistemology and Method in Comparative Political Science group (led by Prof. Flávio Rezende) and the Laboratory of Religion and Politics Studies (led by Prof. Joanildo Burity). 
 
Additionally, I collaborate with the Métodos em Pauta initiative, which aims to foster discussions on scientific methodology and inferential quality in Social Sciences.
