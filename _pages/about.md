I’m a PhD student in Political Science at the [Graduate Program in Political Science (PPGCP)](https://www.ufpe.br/politica) at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE). I hold a Master’s in Political Science (Democracy and Institutions) from the same program, as well as a B.A. in International Relations. I also have training in Public Policy Evaluation from the School of Innovation and Public Policies (EIPP/FUNDAJ).

My research interests include Public Policy Evaluation, Public Opinion, Evangelicals, and Data Analysis. I am a member of the [Epistemology and Method in Comparative Political Science](http://dgp.cnpq.br/dgp/espelhogrupo/45503) group (led by Prof. Flávio Rezende) and the [Laboratory of Religion and Politics Studies](https://laberpfundajufpe.medium.com/) (led by Prof. Joanildo Burity). 
 
Additionally, I collaborate with the [Métodos em Pauta initiative](https://x.com/metodosempauta), which aims to foster discussions on scientific methodology and inferential quality in Social Sciences.
