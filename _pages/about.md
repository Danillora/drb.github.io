I’m a PhD student in Political Science at the [Graduate Program in Political Science (PPGCP)](https://www.ufpe.br/politica) at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE). I hold a Master’s in Political Science (Democracy and Institutions) from the same program, as well as a B.A. in International Relations. I also have training in Public Policy Evaluation from the School of Innovation and Public Policies (EIPP/FUNDAJ).

My research interests include Public Policy Evaluation, Public Opinion, Evangelicals, and Data Analysis. I am a member of the [Epistemology and Method in Comparative Political Science](http://dgp.cnpq.br/dgp/espelhogrupo/45503) group (led by Prof. Flávio Rezende) and the [Laboratory of Religion and Politics Studies](https://laberpfundajufpe.medium.com/) (led by Prof. Joanildo Burity). 
 
Additionally, I collaborate with the [Métodos em Pauta initiative](https://x.com/metodosempauta), which aims to foster discussions on scientific methodology and inferential quality in Social Sciences. I also run [Brewed Evidence](https://brewed-evidence.quarto.pub/home/), a blog where I write about academic things and other interests. The project is still in its early stages.

For more details, you can check my academic CV (Lattes), repositories, and social networks in the menu on the left side of the page. :)
